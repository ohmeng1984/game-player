	      					<p>In early 1999, Final Fantasy VIII for the Sony PlayStation sold millions of copies within days of its release in Japan. Now, one year later, the epic role-playing game has become available for the PC with much less fanfare surrounding its publication, probably because most everyone who wanted to play Final Fantasy VIII already has. What's more, the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII seems hell-bent on completely alienating its audience of innocently curious computer gamers, as they'll likely end up utterly bewildered if they ever made the mistake of buying it. That's because Final Fantasy VIII for the PC is a completely inadequate conversion of the attractive yet problematic console role-playing game.</p>
	      					<p>Final Fantasy VIII would have looked and sounded much better if it were originally a PC game. It might look good on a television, but on the PC you'll immediately notice all the flaws in Final Fantasy VIII's graphics. The characters are made of simple polygonal shapes, and they're painted with blurry, low-resolution texture maps. The background scenery fares even worse; the game's characters look sharper and much more detailed compared with the washed-out settings throughout the game. This makes everything clash and makes the whole game look much worse than it should. You can tell Final Fantasy VIII is a beautiful game underneath it all; the composition and design of virtually every scene are of exceptional quality. The game has a cohesive cinematic appearance, consistently inventive artistic design, and remarkably high production values throughout, even though its appearance is mired under what seems like a coat of dust.</p>
	      					<div id="demo1" class="collapse">
	      					<img src="images/ps/FinalFantasy8/FinalFantasy8-1.jpg" alt="FinalFantasy8-1">
						    <p>That's the problem: Although Final Fantasy VIII looked stunning on the PlayStation, its visuals seem to lose far too much quality in translation to the PC. You'll frequently get frustrated looking for the hotspot to exit a screen; then again, you'll also frequently witness some of the most impressive computer-generated cinematic sequences ever made. The game's frame rate is fairly smooth during most gameplay sequences, but it slows to a crawl whenever you're traveling between destinations on the 3D map. Even its soundtrack suffers from the translation, because it was originally designed to be played through the PlayStation's proprietary music synthesizer; but on the PC, the game's epic score just sounds twangy and annoying, because most PC sound cards are ill equipped to emulate the PlayStation's electronic instruments.</p>
						    <p>Fortunately, Final Fantasy VIII generally looks good enough that you could learn to tolerate the shortcomings of its translated graphics and sound; the characters may lack detail, but they're so vividly motion-captured that they'll captivate you anyway. But Final Fantasy VIII's greatest technical feat has to be how it manages to interpolate 3D characters onto static backgrounds that seamlessly shift into pre-rendered full motion video. There are several scenes throughout the game that blend gameplay sequences with cinematic cutscenes so seamlessly and so beautifully that it's impossible not to be impressed at the sight of them.</p>
						    <p>Though it may take some effort on your part to put up with Final Fantasy VIII's muddled visual quality, it'll be even harder to deal with how the game plays. Final Fantasy VIII features a great story that uses some of the most common, most obvious plot devices - love, friendship, time travel - and somehow manages to make them interesting and complicated, yet completely accessible and even rather plausible. But to get to the heart of the story, you must wade through countless random monster encounters and other tedious gameplay sequences that will try your patience to the very limits. Worse yet, because the PC version is a straight port of the PlayStation game, you must navigate the game's complicated menus and controls using just a keyboard or a gamepad. Yet the game's most embarrassing throwback to its console roots has to be its save-game system, which reads your hard drive as though it were a PlayStation memory card. Even so, as with the ported graphics, you might grudgingly learn to deal with the console-style controls. Unfortunately, coping with the game's gaudy and far-too-slow combat sequences will probably take a lot more effort than the game is worth. Combat in Final Fantasy VIII pits your team of characters - usually three at a time - against its enemies in a turn-based battle that forces you to respond to each turn in real time. The pacing of the combat couldn't be any worse; while the characters all animate smoothly and realistically, they go through each motion much too deliberately. You must make your moves quickly, but the moves themselves take way too long to execute. In addition, your success in combat necessarily involves becoming very familiar with the game's entirely abstract, incredibly clumsy, but nonetheless fairly interesting junction system. Essentially, it lets you bolster each of your characters' statistics by attaching particular magic spells to the particular traits. It takes a while to learn, and it grows even more convoluted as your characters gain experience and additional options and abilities, but in the end the junction system does allow for some strategic depth if you give in to learning its nuances.</p>
						    <img src="images/ps/FinalFantasy8/FinalFantasy8-6.jpg" alt="FinalFantasy8-6">
						    <p>As if the junction system weren't enough, each of your characters must also be equipped with a guardian force, which is a summoned creature without whom your character couldn't cast magic, use items, or do much of anything during battle. Guardian forces can be triggered in combat at any time, and through most of the game, they'll be your most potent weapons, as they inflict massive damage to all enemies onscreen compared with the damage your characters inflict with their regular physical attacks. So there's no real reason not to just summon your guardians all the time; the only problem is that each time you do, you must sit through a long animated sequence as the guardian executes its attack. The guardians' attacks look stupendous: They cast gigantic fireballs and vast showers of ice; they create floods and black holes. However, you'll have to see such sequences so frequently that you'll grow bored to death of them very soon, yet you must use them over and over anyway. Consequently, Final Fantasy VIII's combat is its least enjoyable element, as well as a very serious detriment to the entire game. Part of the problem is that the combat has very little to do with anything that actually goes on in Final Fantasy VIII. The story does little to justify the existence of the junction system or the guardian forces; similarly, the random monster encounters you'll constantly deal with have no bearing on much of anything. Your characters gain levels as they earn experience points, but you'll soon find that the monsters they face are always at an equivalent level, so there isn't even the underlying incentive that your party is becoming more powerful with each victory. Then again, if you took away the combat, you'd find that there's very little actual gameplay in Final Fantasy VIII; when you're not fighting, you're probably just reading through onscreen dialogue as you watch your characters interact. There are few occasions in which you get a chance to make a choice in the dialogue, and even fewer occasions when that choice actually has any impact. The game does have a few interesting interactive sequences in between all the talking and fighting, but they're very rare. As you play, you'll likely get the overwhelming sense that Final Fantasy VIII would have been a lot better if you could just watch it rather than take any part in it.</p>
						    <p>You could speculate as to how much better the game could have been in any number of ways, not the least of which being if it actually took advantage of the modern PC's superior power. But as it stands, there's no reason anybody should opt for the PC version of Final Fantasy VIII over the original, if only because the PlayStation game looks and sounds so much better. And if you don't already have a PlayStation, then you shouldn't even bother with the game in the first place. Its interesting story and impressive visual design aren't enough to recommend it in the face of all its ill-conceived, tedious, and irritating gameplay conventions, which are essentially impossible to deal with if you're neither a longtime fan of the series nor an eternally patient player.

	      				<blockquote class="blockquote">
	      					<p>While Alone in the Dark may have been the forefather of the survival horror genre, Capcom's Resident Evil series perfected it, with each installment improving on its predecessor with finesse and style. Now Capcom's bread 'n' butter flagship series (no, not Street Fighter, silly) is back in the form of Resident Evil 3 Nemesis.</p>
	      					<p>It seems Jill Valentine just managed to get cleaned up from her adventures in the original RE. When she returns to Raccoon City, it seems as though the entire Umbrella incident has been swept under the rug. Disenchanted, she quits the STARS force, hoping to catch up with Chris Redfield, who's already backpacking through Europe en route to investigating Umbrella's European headquarters. But before Jill can get out of Dodge, the zombies come back in force, putting an abrupt halt to her plans.</p>
	      					<div id="demo2" class="collapse">
						    <p>Taking place the day/night before the events that transpire in RE2, Nemesis, ironically, is the most sophisticated of all the RE games, both graphically and in terms of gameplay. While it stays true to the format, keeping the prerendered backgrounds of the previous games, RE3 is the most accomplished of the three. If you thought the graphics in RE2 were pretty sharp, Nemesis' are of even greater detail, with a higher resolution and get this - the loading times are faster. Jill Valentine is also easy on the eyes, looking light years ahead of the comparatively blocky models in the original game. Smooth light sourcing and practically flawless character models give the game an extremely sharp look.</p>
						    <img src="images/ps/ResidentEvil3/ResidentEvil3-3.jpg" alt="ResidentEvil3-3">
						    <p>In terms of gameplay, the controls remain largely the same. While it would be interesting to see how the Biohazard series would function with more of a 3D-platform game-control scheme, anyone comfortable with the RE setup will find RE3's even better. For starters, Capcom has implemented an auto-aiming function that doesn't detract whatsoever from the challenge in the game. What this does is keep you from wasting your ammo trying to line up shots from difficult angles. There is also a defensive sidestep that lets you dodge when an enemy attacks you, something Nemesis (he has a rocket launcher, the rat!) does with vigor. Thankfully, during your travels, you'll find that the game's puzzles are a lot more reasonable, with none of that "ooh, I'm dying, please go all the way across the mansion and solve tricky puzzles to get me the antidote, only to return and find that I'm dead anyway" stuff.</p>
						    <p>Another new feature initiated in RE3 is the ammo system. Throughout the game you will come across all types of gunpowder, which you will use to create a variety of ammunition for the various weapons you collect. Which powders you mix together will determine what sort of ammo you come up with (explosive, acid, etc.). And you'll want to collect as much of it that you can because you will definitely need it by the end of the game. Nemesis does not go down easily. There is also a new pick-your-path feature that lets you opt for one of two choices during key points of the game. Which action you choose will dictate how the game continues. You can play through this game a number of times and not see the same things twice - which is great, but this leads us to the "downside" of the game.</p>
						    <img src="images/ps/ResidentEvil3/ResidentEvil3-6.jpg" alt="ResidentEvil3-6">
						    <p>If you were spoiled by the two-character system in the first game, and super-spoiled by the two-character, two-disc, four-scenario system of the second game, then you'll be disappointed when you find that there is only one character and one disc to play in RE3. While this really isn't all that big of a deal by comparison, the game is over a lot sooner than the previous two games. In fact, aside from a brief jaunt as Carlos Oliveira (an Umbrella mercenary), you pretty much make your way through the game as Jill and only Jill. Fortunately, there is a not-so-mini minigame that opens up after you beat the game that lets you win points and buy weapons with unlimited ammo, which you can use to play through the main game a second time.</p>
						    <p>While it may seem as if Resident Evil fans are getting shortchanged on this one, it really isn't the case. Judged on its own merits, Resident Evil 3 is a truly outstanding game. Unlike other series (Street Fighter, Tomb Raider) that offer incremental "improvements," the RE lineup continues to refine an already excellent premise. This is a series with legs, and each new chapter does nothing to diminish it.

Some are fighting for revenge, some for honor, Ultimately, all are fighting for their lives and the fate of all mankind.</p>

	      					<p>In the world of fighting games, Namco's Tekken 3 stands alone. Although there were some doubts about its conversion from the arcade's System 12 board to the PlayStation, and concerns that Tekken 3 would be just be a slightly better Tekken 2, those fears are unfounded. Not only is Tekken 3's core game as close as you can get to arcade perfect without getting a new machine, the extra features included make it the most well rounded fighter on the market.</p>
	      					<p>As the PlayStation reaches the three year mark, more and more games are seriously pushing its limits, and Tekken 3 is one of those that makes it very apparent that the PlayStation is reaching its physical limits. At first glance, Tekken 3 looks just like it did in the arcade. The animation speed is impressive, and the textures are cunningly crafted to make the lower-resolution models look as good as possible. However, after a while, you will notice that the characters are significantly chunkier, and despite all efforts, the backgrounds are still simple 2D backdrops. Still, it's the best-looking fighter on the PlayStation this side of Tobal 2.</p>
	      					<div id="demo3" class="collapse">
	      					<img src="images/ps/Tekken3/Tekken3-1.jpg" alt="Tekken3-1">
						    <p>Tekken's fighting system is arcade-perfect. Arguably, it still is one of the best on the PlayStation. For those new to the series, Tekken uses two punch buttons and two kick buttons to simulate the left and right sides, and as such, will be unique until Bio Freaks comes out in the US. It a fighting system that's worked extremely well for Tekken over the years, and it's just gotten faster and better. There's a huge number of moves and combos available now -- almost as many as Virtua Fighter 3 from Sega, which isn't on the Saturn. It's not so much an improvement upon the Tekken series as a maturation. The characters seem well-balanced, and some of them have been reworked to be less cheap (can you say Lei?). All in all, this game is more even than any of the previous ones.</p>
						    <p>Of course, as a fighting game, Tekken 3 is everything you'd hoped it would be, but without the classic Namco extras, this would just another really good fighting game. The ending FMVs are back, and if they're any indication, Namco's upcoming CG movie is going to be stunning. The animators have progressed to the point where realistic hair and human models are uncannily real, down to individual strands. Check out Lei's ending just to see how good they look. While we don't mention FMV normally, it's become part and parcel of each Tekken to have one for each ending movie for each character, and it's one of the fine touches that make Tekken one step above everything else.</p>
						    <p>As fighting games continue on and on, more designers are realizing that fighting just isn't enough. Ending FMVs, extra battle modes, quest-style RPGs are seeping into the genre. Nobody realizes it better than Namco, and one of the reasons that Tekken 3 gets the top score is because it has two excellent alternative play modes: Force mode and Ball mode. Ball mode is the already popular beach ball competition which places the Tekken characters on the beach and in a duel to the inflated air death. Force mode is the Final Fight style side-scroller mode. Both of these are surprisingly playable and complete -- they're well thought out instead of being mere throwaways. Although they're limited in appeal, such alternative modes are going to be the wave of the future, and Namco has made a great start.</p>
						    <img src="images/ps/Tekken3/Tekken3-4.jpg" alt="Tekken3-4">
						    <p>Tekken 3 on the PlayStation is the most well-rounded fighting package on the market. Not only does it provide an excellent fighting game, but the extra modes and practice features make it the benchmark for fighters to come. The only gripe that we'd have with it is that Namco's set the bar so high that we shudder with anticipation and dread over what the designers'll have to do to top this.
